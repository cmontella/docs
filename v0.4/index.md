## Install guide
Need to install Eve on your machine? [Head here](/v0.3/install/) for step-by-step directions.

## Quickstart
If you’re new to Eve and want a hands-on demo to learn the language, you can jump right in with a 5 minute [quickstart guide](/v0.3/tutorials/quickstart/) that shows you how to build a simple incrementing counter.

## Syntax reference
Want a reminder how the syntax works or to get an overview of Eve without going through the quickstart? The [syntax reference](/v0.3/syntaxreference/) is a good place to start.

## Libraries
Want to know everything Eve can do? [Here’s a list](/v0.3/handbook/libraries/stdlib/) of all the functions, operators, and watchers available in the language.
